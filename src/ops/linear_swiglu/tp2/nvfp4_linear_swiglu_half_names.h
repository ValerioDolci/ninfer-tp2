// Renames that turn upstream's NVFP4 linear_swiglu sources into the [17408,5120] half's when a
// translation unit of this directory includes them. Include it once, after the family's headers
// and right before the upstream source. The decode and TMA launchers read the rows from the weight
// and are shared, not renamed.
